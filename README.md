# DeepFashion2 Project

Mostly for fun, I am working on this project to perform object classification and detection on 13 different items of clothing. 

As a short description of this dataset, there are 191K training images with 13 different object classes and anywhere between 1 and 8 bounding boxes across the dataset. This data is too large to fit into github memory, so please refer to the link below. 

## Dataset:
https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2

All the detailed information about this dataset is at this link. 

## Method
As an initial method, I am using the Faster R-CNN, which an accurate and fast object detection algorithm. 

Here is the pretrained model repo: https://github.com/kbardool/keras-frcnn
