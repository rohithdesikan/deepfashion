# Deep Fashion 2 Project

This project performs object detection on  various items of clothing from 191,000 images. As a short description of this dataset, there are 191K training images with 13 different object classes and anywhere between 1 and 8 bounding boxes across the dataset. This data is too large to fit into github memory, so please refer to the link below.
